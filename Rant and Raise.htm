<h1>Rant and Raise</h1>

<p>So I had this idea for an app - I'm probably sure that it already exists.</p>

<p>It's like this - you have a page and on it are bunch of buttons.</p>

<p>Like "Racism", "Sexism", "Guardian Moronic", "UKIP/Tory Nazism", "Censorship."</p>

<p>And you tie them to a charity - each of the buttons is tied to a charity.</p>

<p>And every time you click on one of the the buttons, you give a pound to the
charity that you've hooked it up to - maybe you're prompted to give the
link to an article.</p>

<p>So for example, whenever the Daily Mail publishes an article (or Channel 4 produces a programme) spreading fear and loathing of Gypsies, I just go to the "Rant and Raise" app on my phone and push the "Gypsy" button.</p>

<p>And then on twitter is says something like "Mark just gave 1 pound to the
Gypsy Council of Great Britian so he could feel good rather than bad about this
annoying article (link to bigotry)"</p>

<p>Yeah - that's the idea.</p>
