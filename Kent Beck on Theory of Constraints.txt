# Kent Beck on Theory of Constraints

>A weakness of the Theory of Constraints is that it is a model: a map, not
the territory. People develop software ; they are not boxes in a model. The
closer an organization is to efficient but superficially chaotic
communication the less accurate the mapping will be into the world of the
Theory of Constraints and back again. Software development is a human
process not a factory.
