# Button Hook Turns

Button hook turns are a John Boyd idea.

Are they a fantasy? The idea of a button hook turn is that you change direction so fast that you completely wrong-foot your opponents.

They *sound* like a good idea. But are they just a fantasy, compared, say to steady increases in competence, and the point at which a bunch of them align and you get "punctuated equilibria".

Of course one way of creating a buttonhook turn is a burst of speed.  Another one (I'm not quite sure how this works, say in the world of professional careers) is slowing down, or simply just changing tempo.

That's another thing that John Boyd teaches "Faster" doesn't have to be a lot faster to cause confusion in your opponents.
