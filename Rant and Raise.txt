# Rant and Raise

So I had this idea for an app - I'm probably sure that it already exists.

It's like this - you have a page and on it are bunch of buttons.

Like "Racism", "Sexism", "Guardian Moronic", "UKIP/Tory Nazism", "Censorship."

And you tie them to a charity - each of the buttons is tied to a charity.

And every time you click on one of the the buttons, you give a pound to the
charity that you've hooked it up to - maybe you're prompted to give the
link to an article.

So for example, whenever the Daily Mail publishes an article (or Channel 4 produces a programme) spreading fear and loathing of Gypsies, I just go to the "Rant and Raise" app on my phone and push the "Gypsy" button.

And then on twitter is says something like "Mark just gave 1 pound to the
Gypsy Council of Great Britian so he could feel good rather than bad about this
annoying article (link to bigotry)"

Yeah - that's the idea.
