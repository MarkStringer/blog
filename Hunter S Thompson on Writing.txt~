#Hunter S. Thompson on Writing

>I find that by putting things in writing I can understand them and see them a little more objectively. … For words are merely tools and if you use the right ones you can actually put even your life in order, if you don't lie to yourself and use the wrong words.
        
*Letter to Larry Callen (14 July 1958)*
