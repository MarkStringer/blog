#Agile Project Governance

What if Agile project governance looked almost nothing like "normal"
project governance?

What if APG were totally cognizant of a few things -

* What you see is all there is.
* Most traditional project management documentation and governance is
designed to obscure risks, real value and real costs.
* On an Agile project what the Governance structure should be seeing is lots
of problems and reports of slow progress because that shows that stuff is
actually being done.
