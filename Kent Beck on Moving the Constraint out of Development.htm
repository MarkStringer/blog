<h1>Kent Beck on Moving the Constraint out of Development</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here's a sad but repeated story: a development team begins applying XP,
  dramatically improves quality and productivity , but then is disbanded ,
  its leaders fired and the rest of the team scattered. Why does this happen?
  From the Theory of Constraint perspective, the team's improved performance
  shifted the constraint elsewhere in the organization. The new constraint
  (e.g. marketing, who can't decide what they want fast enough) doesn't like
  the spotlight. Nobody actually cares about organizational throughput. The
  "source" of the turmoil, XP, is blamed and eliminated.</p>
