<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In my early days at the hospital I made the mistake of directly challenging some of the delusions, before realising it was a futile effort.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>With time, I found it more productive re-directing the conversations away to more solid ground.</strong></p>
