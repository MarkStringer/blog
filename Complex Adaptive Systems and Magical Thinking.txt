# Complex Adaptive Systems and Magical Thinking

And it's got me thinking about complex adaptive systems.  I always
think about the Lean/Kanban question of "what is it?"

I'm starting to wonder if the question is "what does it want?" Weird
that Dawkins has recently had a pop at magical thinking - didn't he
make all his money anthropomorphising genes?
