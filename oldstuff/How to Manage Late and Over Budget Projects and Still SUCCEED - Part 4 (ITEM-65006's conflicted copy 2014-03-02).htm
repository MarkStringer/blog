<p>Change the way that you look at the world of work and get a better understanding of:</p>

<p><strong>Why are so many projects Late and Over-Budget?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What can you do to make sure that these projects STILL succeed? (and even have fun in the process)</strong></p>

<p>This is the FOURTH in a series of FREE seminars that explore these fundamental questions.</p>

<p>This month we're going to be talking about "The Gervais Principle" as outlined by Venkatesh Rao and based on Hugh MacLeod's bleak cartoon.</p>

<p>Can the world of work really be divided into the Losers, the Clueless and the Sociopaths?</p>

<p>Is there a way of thinking about this and discussing these ideas that isn't so crushingly negative?</p>

<p>If people who work (and therefore people who work on projects) can be classified thus, what can we do about it? </p>

<p>What should we do about it? </p>

<p>Is it still possible to make sure that projects succeed?</p>

<p>Suggested reading: Venkatesh Rao's ebook</p>
