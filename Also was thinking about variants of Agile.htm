<h1>Also - was thinking about variants of Agile</h1>

<p>Was reading about genetic algorithms. Some guy generating
self-replicating bits of code.  Was reading that he started out with
bits of code that were 80 bytes long which could replicated
themselves, but pretty soon, he ended up with bits of code that were
45 bytes long, which couldn't replicated themselves, but were
parasitic on the 80 bytes of code versions.</p>

<p>Wondering if the same thing could be true for Agile methodologies -
instantly thought about Kanban - much shorter than Scrum, but what
about extreme programming and Scrum? Scrum with extreme programming as
the bacteria in its guts...</p>
