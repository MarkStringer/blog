<h1>Extreme Programming and Accounting</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem lies in how accounting handles software development, not in XP
  itself. Blindly applying accounting models from the world of factories and
  widgets to an activity as different as software development inevitably
  creates distortions in the accounts. There is interesting work to be done
  outside the scope of XP in rethinking a mutually beneficial relationship
  between accounting and software development.</p>
