<h1>Free Seminar - Verbal Self-Defence</h1>

<p>I was talking with a guy who is a Krav Maga instructor. And I thought of
something which had occurred to me several times before - isn't it amazing
how many people spend so much time learning how to defend themselves from
physical attacks? I wonder why people don't spend so much time learning how
to defend themselves from verbal attacks.  After all, the last time I was
involved in physical fight was 23 years ago.  The last time I was involved
in verbal fight was  90 minutes ago - a disagreement over what time myself
and the Krav Maga guy should have turned up for an appointment - we lost!</p>

<p>So on Tuesday I'm going to give a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/verbal-self-defence-a-free-seminar-tickets-11937121251">90 minute seminar on Verbal
Self-Defence.</a>  The seminar's free and it's the last of these "Late and
Over-Budget" evening seminars that I'll give (I might do an online version
of this last seminar as well as the "in the flesh" version).</p>

<p>What will we cover in the seminar?  Well, in the spirit of "Training from
the Back of the Room" which is one of my inspirations for my approach,
here's the "4C's" outline for the seminar.</p>

<h2>Connections [writing][talking] - 15 Mins</h2>

<p>Just take a minute to think about some verbal attacks that you have
suffered - what was the result of those verbal attacks? What would be
different if you could defend yourself more effectively from those kinds of
verbal attacks?</p>

<h2>Concepts [listening] - 30 Mins</h2>

<p>Luke Archer's concept of creating "imbalance" in your opponent.</p>

<p>Luke Archer's concept of returning your opponent to balance.</p>

<p>Luke Archer's concept of inserting a moment of thought between the stimulus
and the response.</p>

<p>Suzette Elgin Haden's concept of "Blamer mode", "Computer mode" and "Leveller mode."
It's not about you - a Buddhist approach to self-defence and Harry Frankfurt on Bullshit.</p>

<h2>Concrete Practice [listening][talking][moving] - 30 Minutes</h2>

<p>Tug of War
A really, really safe version of "Butters."
The Hat Game</p>

<h2>Conclusions [listening][talking][writing]</h2>

<p>What did you learn?  What can you do next?</p>
