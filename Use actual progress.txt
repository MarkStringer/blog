# Use actual progress

This is a series about project management, being a Scrum Master, managing software development, whateveryou want to call it. This is how I do it. 

It's a series of very quick sketches. I found another post where I made a list, and it's a good list, of things to write about. And the first one is "Use actual progress."

Kent Beck, the originator of Extreme Programming said "The disease of software development is optimism, feedback is the cure."
