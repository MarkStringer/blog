<h1>Kent Beck on Working at a Sustainable Pace</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a limit to how much work can be done in a day. Paying attention
  to this real limit allows you to plan effectively and deliver successfully.
  Saying that programmers should just accomplish twice as much doesnâ€™t work.
  They can gain skills and effectiveness, but they cannot get more done on
  demand. More time at the desk does not equal increased productivity for
  creative work.</p>
