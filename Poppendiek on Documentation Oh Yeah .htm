<h1>Poppendiek on Documentation - Oh Yeah!</h1>

<p>The biggest waste of all in document handoffs is that documents don't
- can't, really - contain all of the information that the next person
in line needs to know. Great amounts of tacit knowledge remain with
the creator of the document and never get handed off to the receiver.
Moving artifacts from one group to another is a huge source of waste
in software development.</p>
