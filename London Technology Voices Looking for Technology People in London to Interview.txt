# London Technology Voices: Looking for Technology People in London to Interview

I've got this idea...

...that I've been percolating for a while, and I thought I'd just
share it with you.

Relax, it's not earth-shattering.  The idea is to do a podcast (isn't
that what they used to call them) or an audioblog where I interview
movers and shakers in the London technology scene (it doesn't have to
be the London technology scene, it can be anywhere on the planet, but
London is where I live, and I can't afford/be arsed to travel. The
idea is that I do the interviews for free (I don't pay them, they
don't pay me) but they get to (within limits) plug whatever product,
consultancy or company that they're pushing and I get to, occasionally
mention my courses - which at the moment, I'm toying with calling:

**Managing in Technology: An Alternative Guide to Project Management,
Software Development, Love, Pain and the Whole Damn Thing.**

I'll also put the podcast up and get the interview transcribed so that
it's searchable online.

My inspirations for this are many, but include the [work that I did
when I was at Sussex,](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sussex.ac.uk%2FUsers%2Fgeraldin%2FPublications%2FPervasive_Stringer_Dist.pdf&ei=AE6lU9D4IoHJPMvmgIgG&usg=AFQjCNF7u36Jx-DGxBq8OuVpVN-04rpX5w&sig2=-tQ9ey5d4psy4I2F1Gt88Q&bvm=bv.69411363,d.ZWU&cad=rja)
a mere one career ago and went around interviewing people in their
homes about technology and [Stud's Terkel's book
"Working".](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1565843428?ie=UTF8&camp=3194&creative=21330&creativeASIN=1565843428&linkCode=shr&tag=theginmum-21&qid=1403342650&sr=8-1&keywords=studs+terkel+work)

Obviously, because Agile is my "bag", I'm certainly interested to talk
to anybody who's doing Agile stuff, but I'm also interested in talking
to people who are doing start-up stuff.

So, if you want to be one of the first to be interviewed - or know
someone who you think I should interview, please get in touch.

PS - This is a quote from the technology in the home paper that I
wrote when I was at Sussex, and I still love:

>*"This is my chair and no-one else is allowed to sit here. And that's my work basket, the radio and I always have you can see, the Ikea catalogue [laughs]
and my crossword.*

>*I sit here and I can see the cooker and I can hear the front door and I can answer the phone and I'm near the back door and I can see the sink.* 

>*My poor husband has nothing like this, but then he doesn't do anything like that. I organise the house I run the house, I do all the paperwork."  - [Megan]*
