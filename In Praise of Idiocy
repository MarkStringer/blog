#In Praise of Idiocy

We need stupid people.  We need dumb ideas.  Stupid people have sex.  It's what old Uncle Dick Dawkin's "selfish gene" wants. Dumb people.  Fucking.  Dumb people raising dumb kids with dumb ideas. Without them, the species would simply not survive.

All this talk about free speech in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo affair seems to have obscure this fundamental point.  What's good about free speech isn't that what's said is good. What's good about free speech is that all manner of things get said - and most of it is stupid, offensive and downright dangerous.  Are your really surprised by that?  Have you *met* any people?
