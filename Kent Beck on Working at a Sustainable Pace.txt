# Kent Beck on Working at a Sustainable Pace

>There is a limit to how much work can be done in a day. Paying attention
to this real limit allows you to plan effectively and deliver successfully.
Saying that programmers should just accomplish twice as much doesnâ€™t work.
They can gain skills and effectiveness, but they cannot get more done on
demand. More time at the desk does not equal increased productivity for
creative work.
