# More from the big tiny

>Over time, I discovered that learning new things doesn't always liberate
you. Instead, it makes you wonder if your pants are on backward or if the
trees are holding the sky up - it makes you question all of your
assumptions and conventions.

From "The Big Tiny" by Dee Williams.
