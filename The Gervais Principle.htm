<p><em>"Point of view is worth 80 IQ points."</em> - Alan C. Kay.</p>

<p>Change the way that you look at the world of work and get a better understanding of:</p>

<p><strong>Why so many projects are Late and Over-Budget?</strong></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>What can you do to make sure that these projects STILL succeed? (and even have fun in the process)</strong></p>

<p>This month we're going to be talking about a completely different point of view "The Gervais Principle" as outlined by Venkatesh Rao.  </p>

<p>Can the world of work really be divided into the Losers, the Clueless and the Sociopaths? Is there a way of thinking about this and discussing these ideas that isn't so crushingly negative?</p>

<p>If people who work (and therefore people who work on projects) can be classified thus, what can we do about it? What should we do about it? Is it still possible to make sure that projects succeed?</p>

<p>Suggested reading: Venkatesh Rao's ebook</p>

<p>It would be great to see you. It's fine to just turn up on the night but if you want to ask questions beforehand or let me know you're coming, get in touch.</p>
