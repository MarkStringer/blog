#Potential Blog Posts

Here are some blog posts that I feel the need to write.  As you can see I am greatly concerned that I increase my understanding of Dev Ops and AWS Cloud and also Scaled Agile

* What is Vagrant
* What is App Monitoring?
* What is Puppet
* What is CI
* What is CD
* What is AWS
* What is the promise of microservices? Will it deliver?
* How are all the cool kids doing deployment pipelines
* Is all this cloud stuff "just" something else?
* What is SAFE?
* What is DAD?
* What is Less?
* What is Nexus?
* What we talk about when we talk about "Scaled Agile"
* Managing transformations using equilibria rather than absolutes
