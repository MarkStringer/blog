<h1>Agile Project Governance</h1>

<p>What if Agile project governance looked almost nothing like "normal"
project governance?</p>

<p>What if APG were totally cognizant of a few things -</p>

<ul>
<li>What you see is all there is.
</li>
<li>Most traditional project management documentation and governance is
designed to obscure risks, real value and real costs.
</li>
<li>On an Agile project what the Governance structure should be seeing is lots
of problems and reports of slow progress because that shows that stuff is
actually being done.
</li>
</ul>
