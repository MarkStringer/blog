# Want to Get Better at Verbal Self Defence? Get Over Your "Self".

Two stories to start off with.  I once went to a session run by [Benjamin
Mitchell]( https://twitter.com/benjaminm) where he ran a session of ["The
Red Bead Game"](http://www.redbead.com/what/) invented by management guru
W. Edwards Deming.  Benjamin was playing the role of a ruthless manager -
and this was definitely helped by it being "Movember" in honour of which,
he was sporting a highly dubious moustache.



The way that "The Red Bead Game" works is that volunteers are brought up
from the audience and a task is explained to them.  They are given a paddle
which has 10 bead-sized holes drilled in it and asked to place the paddle
in a bucket of thousands of beads where the ratio of beads is 9 white beads
to every 1 red bead.  The object of the exercise is to avoid collecting any
red beads with the paddle, but the volunteer has no control over this.  The
way in which the paddle is inserted into the bucket is strictly defined so
that the volunteer has no lee-way.



The whole purpose of the red bead game is to show simultaneously how most
of the flaws in a process can be attributed to the process rather than the
individuals involved.  At the same time - as the game progresses the
"management" of the red bead game celebrate the volunteers who have
"avoided" collecting a large number of red beads, and warn, scold and
eventually fire the volunteers who get a large number of red beads.



But here's the weird thing. A particularly tall volunteer was "winning"
i.e. by total luck he was getting the least number of red beads and the guy
next to me was watching this and saying "Oh he's good isn't he?"



Me: I'm sorry.

Guy: He's good isn't he?  He's got talent.

Me: Erm. But the whole point of this exercise is to show that success and
failure in this game are random.

Guy: Yeah. Right! He knows something. He's got talent!

Me: ???



Can you just imagine what this guy would have thought if *he'd* been
winning at the red bead game, or indeed, if he'd been "fired" for losing.



And then there's that Larsen cartoon with the bear hiding behind a tree and
the hunter creeping up on him and the bear is thinking "Yeah, he's
definitely shooting at me, now let me think - do I know this guy?"



Both of these stories - the red bead game and the Larsen cartoon are
examples of misunderstandings and exaggerations of the individual
contribution to any situation.  Which brings me to the central point of
this post.



**Most of your problems stem from your exaggerated and misunderstood sense
of self**



 - there I've said it.  And I certainly don't just mean YOU! There you go
again! I mean everybody.  Including me, but, well, and this is hard to
take, not especially me.



One of the reasons I've been thinking about this is I've just recently been
reading ["Thoughts Without a Thinker"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0465050948?ie=UTF8&camp=3194&creative=21330&creativeASIN=0465050948&linkCode=shr&tag=theginmum-21&qid=1402212659&sr=8-1&keywords=thoughts+without+a+thinker)
by Mark Epstein which highlights this fundamental principle of Buddhism -
that all of our problems (or most of the fundamental, insoluble, ones) come
from our exaggerated sense of self and a refusal to see that in a very
important ways we are not separate from the rest of the world.  This is
obviously a very huge subject, and just writing this I'm starting to feel
that I'm in way over my head.



But at the same time as reading this, I've been reading about verbal
self-defence.  One of the books I've been reading is a book from the
seventies by [Suzette Elgin Haden - "The Gentle Art of Verbal
Self-Defence"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0880290307?ie=UTF8&camp=3194&creative=21330&creativeASIN=0880290307&linkCode=shr&tag=theginmum-21&qid=1402213852&sr=8-1&keywords=suzette+elgin+haden).  She has some very interesting things to say.  Elgin Haden draws
distinctions between different modes of communication (actually I think she
borrows them from Virginia Satir, but let's not worry about that too much
just now).



Three modes of communication that are important for this discussion are:



**Blamer Mode** - the mode of explicit attack: "You fucked this up good and
proper didn't you?"

**Computer Mode** - a more "objective" way of communicating: "There seems
to be a big problem here."

**Leveller Mode** - mano a mano: "Look, we all know this was a screw up!
And we know it wasn't all your fault."



Three points that Elgin Haden makes very clearly in relation to these modes.



1)  The most insidious and destructive verbal attacks don't come in Blamer
mode - they're hidden in Computer Mode and in Leveller Mode.

2)  You should never respond to an attack in Blamer Mode.

3)  To a lot of the people playing it isn't personal, it really is a game,
and you show yourself to be a total amateur, a non-combatant even, if you
think it is personal.



I don't know much of the history of how Haden-Elgin's book came about, but
it clearly sees it's self as part of the battle of the sexes - somehow
imagining that all men are naturally accomplished at verbal sparring.

>An amazingly high percentage of men, with absolute honesty, are astonished
when they find that the verbal attacks they've carried out in courtroom or
at the conference table are resented by a woman on the receiving end. THEY
ARE NOT PRETENDING THEY TRULY DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

>Males learn very early that verbal confrontations are a part of the
necessary activity of their careers. They learn to admire the skilled
verbal infighter, to keep track of the "one for you, and one for me" scores
as the confrontations go along, and they do not take any of this
personally. (The man who doesn't learn this is the man who gets passed over
again and again while less able people are promoted over his head).

As a man who hasn't "got" these rules of the game instinctively, I would
claim that gender isn't the dividing line here - the dividing line is
rather between people who "get" it and people who don't.  And the crucial
point to take away from Elgin's observations is that in almost any verbal
conflict, especially in a work situation:

**It isn't about you.**

It's about the whole system that surrounds you. Yes, people may be implying
that you're not competent. Yes people may be implying that if you serious
about your job, you'd be taking on more responsibility.  They may even be
saying this explicitly, and brutally, in "Blamer Mode". They may even be
making personal remarks about your weight, age, gender, attractiveness.
Still more likely than not, they're making a "move in the game" as Suzette
Elgin Haden puts it:

>The fact that women [*and for women here I would put "people who aren't
good at verbal confrontations*] are frequently unable to play this game -
and make no mistake about it, it is just that, a game - limits them forever
to the lower strata of most corporations, universities, hospitals,
publishing houses, and so on. Men [i.e. *people who are good at verbal
confrontations*] look upon it much as they do any other sport: Get in there
and play to win, and then when the final whistle blows, everybody go out
together for pizza and beer. (Or steak and a good red wine, or doughnuts
and coffee depending.)

>-either learn to play the game or forget about a career within the system.

>If you go into a football game and insist upon playing it by the rules of
tennis, you surely have better sense than to think that (a) you will win;
or (b) anybody will ever let you play in their football game again.

As I mentioned yesterday, I was talking to a [Krav Maga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga) instructor who was saying that one
of the main ways of defending yourself was "don't be there".  I think in
physical self-defence terms that means learn to stay out of situations
where you might get into a fight.  But in the terms that we're discussing
here it has an intriguing alternative meaning - when you're being verbally
attacked, reduce your sense of self - see the attack for the game move that
it is and don't let it hit you.

Another book that I've been reading about self-defence - Verbal Aikido by
Luke A Archer would seem to contradict this advice by making it clear that
in any verbal conflict you should be totally present in the moment. But the
interesting thing about being "totally present in the moment" is how this
too involves reducing your sense of self.  Two examples of what I mean.

Let's take one of the most brutal verbal attacks I know of - and unusually
from a film about work (there aren't that many of them).  This clip from
[Glenngary Glen Ross](http://youtu.be/ghQr6KgC95Q?t=1h22m40s) ending at
"you fucking child," (language not safe for work, possibly not even
palatable at home for some people).

For a long time, I thought what was good about this clip was the brutality
of the attack on the Kevin Spacey character (this, I think shows just how
naïve I've been been - and can be - about life and work).  But then I read
Venkatesh Rao's discussion of this same scene Rao points out that the Kevin
Spacey character "wins" this confrontation because even though he's just
been savaged by Al Pacino, he still listens to what the Jack Lemmon
character is saying - [starting here](http://youtu.be/ghQr6KgC95Q?t=1h25m6s).  Because he stays "in the moment" rather than going inside himself and
raging and wailing at how he's been attacked (which is very probably what I
would have done) the Kevin Spacey character figures out that Jack Lemmon is
actually the burglar who broke into the office, and "wins" the
confrontation.  Talk about ["if you can keep your head when all about you
are losing theirs and blaming it on you."]( http://youtu.be/JWvcwVWCcnY)
Wow!

The other example is one that I've talked about a lot in association with
verbal self-defence - [the Hat Game](http://www.mumbly.co.uk/newblog/A%20Thought%20About%20the%20Hat%20Game.htm)
as described by Keith Johnstone.  Johnstone makes the point that people who
are good at the Hat game make good improvisers.  And one reason why that
might be is that being good at the hat game involves being "in the moment"
and not going inside yourself. It's worth quoting at length what Johnstone
says - please go and buy his book, trust me you'll be rewarded by reading
it (again, apologies for the gendered nature of some of these comments,
it's really not what I'm trying to emphasise).

>Most students attach their ego to winning (which turns play into work) so
I say "What's it matter? It's not even your hat! Are you supposed to be an
expert? Of course not! Take risks! Win or lose, either way we'll be
entertained!"

>I noticed that the 'untalented' players (almost all women) stepped
backward, even if only a few inches, whereas the successful players held
their ground, or moved forward, tempting their opponent into making an
ill-advised grab- I stood the retreaters against a wall but they jerked
their heads back and cracked the plaster, so I placed heavy chairs behind
their knees and sometimes I'd walk into a scene and push them forward.  Women
were soon as successful as men, but there was still a baffling connection
between skill at improvisation and skill at taking a hat.

>A Japanese swordsman wrote that if you fight someone who has no plan,
you'll be thinking, I'll do such and such! As your severed head bounces
down the temple steps (well he didn't put it exactly like that.)

>Planners in the Hat Game are at a similar disadvantage- **Hat-Games demand
a split in the players' consciousness: part of the mind plays the scene,
while another part watches attentively.  Until players can make this split
their hats are vulnerable.**

So how do you get better at "staying in the moment" how do you modify your
exaggerated sense of self? Well meditation,especially mindfulness
meditation is supposed to help with the sense of self, and I'm going to
give that a try. Well and I think from a verbal self-defence point of view
I think the answer has to be practice in a safe environment (please, it's
really probably not a good idea to practice with a partner or loved one).  I'm
very interested in trying to set up some "verbal sparring sessions" -
almost like a Verbal fight club.  But the first rule will be not about not
talking about it, it will be "no assholes" (this was another tip I picked
up from the Krav Maga instructor).  If you're interested in coming along to
a verbal sparring session and learning more about verbal self-defence (and
the hat game).  Let me know.
