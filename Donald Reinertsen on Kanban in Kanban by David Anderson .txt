# Donald Reinertsen on Kanban (in Kanban by David Anderson)

The Toyota Production System is elegantly optimized to deal with repetitive
and predictable tasks: tasks with homogeneous task durations and
homogeneous delay costs. Under such conditions it is correct to use
approaches like first-in-first-out (FIFO) prioritization. It is also
correct to block the entry of work when the WIP limit is reached. However,
these approaches are not optimal when we must deal with non-repetitive,
unpredictable jobs; with different delay costs; and different task
durationsâ€”exactly what we must deal with in product development.
