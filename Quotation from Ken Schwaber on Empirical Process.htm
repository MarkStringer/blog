<h1>- Quotation from Ken Schwaber on Empirical Process</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a nutshell, there are two major approaches to controlling any process.  The 'defined' process control model requires that every piece of work be completely understood.  Give a well-defined set of inputs, the same outputs are generated every time.  A defined process can be started and run until completion, with the same results every time.  Tunde said the methodologies that I showed him attempted to use the defined model, but none of the processes or tasks were defined in enough detail to provide repeatability and predictability.</p>
  
  <p>Tunde said my business was an intellectually intensive business that required too much thinking and creativity to be a good candidate for the defined approach.  He theorised that my industry's application of the defined methodologies must have resulted in a lot of surprises, loss of control, and incomplete or just wrong products. <strong>He was particularly amused that the tasks were linked together with dependencies, as though they could predictably start and finish just like a well-defined industrial process.</strong></p>
