# Extreme Programming and Accounting

>The problem lies in how accounting handles software development, not in XP
itself. Blindly applying accounting models from the world of factories and
widgets to an activity as different as software development inevitably
creates distortions in the accounts. There is interesting work to be done
outside the scope of XP in rethinking a mutually beneficial relationship
between accounting and software development.
