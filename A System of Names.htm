<h1>A System of Names</h1>

<p>I heard the idea of a System of Names from a friend of mine a few years
ago, and I rooted out the original blog post, and it was nowhere near as
interesting as I thought it would be.</p>

<p>But now that I'm thinking about governance, this has come back to me.
Governance structures are systems of names.</p>
