<p>This in an experiment.  It's a blog - but it's the simplest kind of blog possible. Using the tiniest amount of software that I wrote myself to make it possible.  I've called it the "Late and Over-budget Notebook" but really it's what Steven Johnson calls a "commonplace" which was a kind of notebook that intellectual Gentlemen kept in the enlightenment.</p>

<p>There's a story here.  And because this isn't the book that I want to write - it's the notes for that book, I can write things in the chronological order that they came rather than trying to structure them as I probably should when I finally come to writing the book.  The reason I came up with the name "Late and Over-Budget" is because a "Go-getter" project manager hung up on me in a phone conference.  He was the chairman of the small web and ipad development company that I was working for at the time and he'd just been insisting that we all sign up to a set of actions that we'd agreed on.  I don't quite know why I was feeling so bloody-minded, actually I do.  I'd already had an argumen with him earlier in the week, where I'd refused to create a "detailed Gantt chart" for the whole of a project.  The reason being that I simply had no idea of the detail of what we would be doing in six month's time, so didn't see the point of making it up.</p>

<p>The result of this flounce-out, storm off wasn't that dramatic - I simply decided not to renew my contract with this company - even though the technical director still wanted me to stay (I've since heard that the "Go-getter" project manager is no longer with the company either).  But it did get me thinking - chiefly it lead me to thinking about the value of plans, and how they're used.  It also made me realise that the bulk of the working life of a project manager is spent in situations where the project is late and over-budget, but the bulk of training and writing about projects is spent telling people what they should do to make sure that their projects aren't late and over-budget.</p>

<p>And so I thought that maybe I could write a book called "Late and Over-Budget" in which I explained why projects were often late and over-budget and what to do about it.  I wrote some of that book, but then I had a bunch of problems.  Here are just a few of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>It came off <em>really</em> negative, not just the title, but the whole tone of the book
</li>
<li>I only really had one explanation of why projects were late and over-budget - which was based on the Cynefin framework, and basically bolied down to saying "software is more complicated than you think."
</li>
<li>The book came off like a bitter non-commissioned officer.  Like an angry sergeant-major yelling.  It seemed very graceless and unappealing.
</li>
<li>Part of the reason that the book came off as a "downstairs" whine about project management was that I was bearing in mind something that I'd read about in a Robert Anton Wilson book - something that he calls the "Snafu Principle."
</li>
<li>I wasn't sure what solutions that I could offer, beyond just this one explanation of why projects are late and over-budget.
</li>
</ul>

<p>So I left it for a bit and continued kept on and <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/333/289.html">"trod the maze of error round"</a> as George Crabbe would say for a bit longer.  I read some more books that added to my understanding of why projects were late and over-budget.  Especially, I read a chapter on "The Planning Fallacy" in Daniel Kahneman's book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0141033576?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3194&amp;creative=21330&amp;creativeASIN=0141033576&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=theginmum-21&amp;qid=1376668906&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=thinking+fast+and+slow">"Thinking Fast and Slow"</a> and this added to my understanding of why so many projects are late and over-budget.  I also, with the concept of "What You See Is All There Is" started to get the first inklings of what a solution might look to the problem of being late and over-budget.</p>

<p>And then a bit of time passed.  And then, I'm not quite sure how (I've sadly got a good idea why) I saw a description of a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1780991568?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3194&amp;creative=21330&amp;creativeASIN=1780991568&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=theginmum-21&amp;qid=1376669188&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dead+man+working">"Dead Man Working"</a> and decided it would be a good idea to buy it.  On the whole it wasn't, not for the book anyway.  It's really just an extended whine by a pair of lefty academics about work.  There was one seriously useful thought in the whole book - although it is a powerful one, which we'll probably come back to at some point - I hope we do, we certainly should.  That thought was the idea that worked simply cannot be described by a set of rules - that one of the most basic ways that a group of workers can a get a system to grind to a halt in fact, is actually <em>work to rule.</em></p>

<p>But the most important thought that I had while I was reading "Dead Man Working" wasn't one that they were expressing or developing. Maybe it was when I was reading a section where they were complaining about having to write a book at the weekends about how work is crap for example because you have to work at the weekens. No, the most important thought that I had while I reading this book was this one:</p>

<p><strong>These guys are losers!!!</strong></p>

<p>Now this may seem like a very insulting thing to say.  But it actually was slightly less insulting and slightly more interesting than it sounds.  Because what I meant by that was that these guys weren't "losers" in the normal sense - they were losers in a specific sense, outline by a blogger and now author called Venkatesh Rao in a blog post that I'd read a couple of years earlier called <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/">"The Gervais Principle."</a>...</p>
