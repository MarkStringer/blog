<h1>Dear Diary</h1>

<p>I had this idea last year to put everything that I wrote in one text file.
I think this was part of recovering from losing Posterous, which had been a
great place to capture everything that I wrote up to that point, but then
one day just went away.</p>

<p>One good thing about putting everything that you wrote in one place is that
you can then make it into an ebook and read it on the train - "something
scandalous to read on the train, etc."  And so I've done that, and I've
been reading through it.I wouldn't say it's a rivetting read, but there are
some bits which are worth reading again - and even some bits which warrant
turning into blog posts.  One thing that is rather dissappointing is that
very often I seem to be going over the same ground again and again without
getting any deeper, or any closer to a real understanding.  Ah well, I
suppose that's a kind of understanding in itself.</p>
