<h1>Macolm Gladwell's Article on Albert O. Hirshman</h1>

<p>It's taken someone pointing <a href="http://t.co/mS9EzdbA2A">this</a> out to me
(thanks Bruce Durling) to see how really important are the things he's
saying.</p>

<p>Maybe that's why doing this kind of thinking is so much easier if you have
a common room to loaf around in, drinking tea in the afternoon.</p>

<p>It also reminds me, rather worryingly of my first encounters with
Wittgenstein.  You read "The meaning of a concept is its use" and you think
"Huh? What the hell does that mean?</p>

<p>And then maybe a year later, you're you find yourself saying to other
people "But don't you see?  The meaning of a concept is its use."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00INYG7C0?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3194&amp;creative=21330&amp;creativeASIN=B00INYG7C0&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=theginmum-21&amp;qid=1399279108&amp;sr=8-1">Flyvbjerg</a> is the new big thinker in this area - I should try to make more
of an effort to read his stuff.  But I'm not impressed by him not being
impressed by Hirschman.  He wouldn't be so doubtful about the hiding hand
if he'd ever tried to provide "realistic" predicitions of when a project is
going to deliver.</p>
