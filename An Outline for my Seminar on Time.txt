#A 4 C's outline for Tonight's Seminar 

**Connections** [Write][Speak]

* In the work that you do - what is "fast" - what would be a short period of time?
* What is slow? - what would be regarded as a long time?
* What is the calendar of events in your organisation?
	
**Concepts** [Listen]

* Talk about tempo
	+ Changes in tempo result in emotion - that's what we're about in "Late and Over-budget" - understanding how project management makes you feel and what you can to make it feel better.
* Talk about clock/calendar time and event time
	+ Clock time costs money - event time delivers value
* Was Toyota's real insight to focus on servicing certain events - manufacturing cars at the rate of need - was the actual event the purchase of the car?
	+ Very often focus is on clock time, but managing projects successfully requires a focus on event time.  This doesn't mean that we ignore clock time.

**Concrete Practice** [Move][Speak][Listen]

* Quiz from page 20 of Geography of time
* Look at James Allen's "Interval Logic"
	+ Are there any other ways in which two events interact?
	+ What might be the advantages or disadvantages of describing events in these ways?
	+ Get into pairs and act them out!!!

**Conclusions** [Speak][Write] 

* What are the "events" in your organisation?
	+ How well are these events being serviced?
	+ How does what you're doing interact with these events?
	+ Did you notice any emotions when we were talking about time and timing?
