<h1>Poppendieck On Top Down Design</h1>

<p>It was once thought that good programmers develop software though a
structured, top-down approach. In 1990, Raymonde Guindon evaluated the
paradigm that top-down decomposition is the best approach to software
design. She reported on research in which experienced designers were
asked to design an elevator control system and to describe each step
of their thought process to researchers. She found that when
experienced designers are presented with ill-defined problems, their
design activities are not at all top-down. They move repeatedly
between scenario examination, requirements elucidation, high-level
solution segmentation, and low-level design of difficult elements.</p>
