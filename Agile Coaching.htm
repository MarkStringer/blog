<h1>Agile Coaching</h1>

<h1>Agile Coaching</h1>

<p>One of the reasons that Agile, and its most popular methodology Scrum, have
been so popular is their relative simplicity.  Scrum is a project
management framework that advocates just 4 meetings (daily stand, sprint
planning, retrospective and show and tell) and 3 roles (ScrumMaster,
Product Owner and Team Member).</p>

<p>So why does such a simple methodology require coaching? Why is there even a
dedicated role of "Agile Coach" and so many people with this job
description? Surely a team of smart developers, testers, business analysts
and project managers can just read about Scrum and Agile, or even go on a
course and then start using these approaches successfully by themselves?  There
are two main reasons that teams tend to struggle to achieve success without
the help of Agile coach: the two Agile principles of transparency and
empirical process.</p>

<h2>Transparency.</h2>

<p>An Agile approach insists that no project can be successful unless there is
clear communication between all of the team members who are working on the
project. The four meetings which Scrum advocates are designed to make clear
to all members of the team what the issues facing a project really are and
what is the actual progress that the project is making.</p>

<p>This kind of transparency is essential for successful software development,
but it comes with its own set of problems.  In our experience conventional
project reporting tends to hide problems and be optimistic and then late in
reporting slow progress and the possibility of missing deadlines. The kind
of clarity that is achieved early on in Agile project of what the issues
are that are slowing a project down – and therefore when a project is
likely to realistically complete can be unnerving for members of the team
and also for the senior management to whom they report. Continuing to
maintain this transparent approach throughout the lifespan of a project
takes courage (another Agile principle).</p>

<p>Agile coaches can help use the transparency that the Agile process
generates both by encouraging the team to be honest about the problems that
they are facing; by reassuring the team, the product owner and senior
stakeholders that such transparency is healthy, normal and will ultimately
result in a more successful outcome for the project; and by demonstrating
these healthy effects as the project progresses.</p>

<h2>Empirical Process</h2>

<p>One of the hardest things for team members who are new to Agile to
understand is the Agile principle of "empirical process". Often beginners –
and sometimes team members who have only worked on a small number of Agile
projects are keen to identify "best practices".  Questions which are often
asked during the early phase of an Agile transformation are "What is the
ideal length of a sprint?"; "who should maintain the product backlog?";
and, rather strangely "When exactly does the previous sprint end and the
next sprint start?".  The standard answers to these questions are "2
weeks"; "the Product Owner, but with the help of the whole team"; and "who
cares?". The principle of empirical process emphasises the idea that every
project is different.  The problems that each project faces are different,
the obstacles that are the limiting factor on the speed of development are
different.  The skills, abilities and dynamic of the team is different. The
availability of a Product Owner, their skills profile and their
relationship with the client organisations is different for every project,
let alone every organisation.</p>

<p>The presence of an Agile coach on a team that is beginning to work in an
Agile way allows the team to work out, together with the coach, how Agile
principles can be applied in any given situation. This allows the real
value of an Agile approach to be realised and avoids the dangers of "cargo
cult Agile" – where the outside appearances of an Agile approach are
observed, but none of the value of an Agile approach are actually realised.</p>
