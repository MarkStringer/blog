<p><strong>Connections</strong> [Write][Speak]</p>

<ul>
<li>In the work that you do - what is "fast" - what would be a short period of time?
</li>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talk about clock/calendar time and event time
<ul>
<li>Clock time costs money - event time delivers value
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Was Toyota's real insight to focus on servicing certain events - manufacturing cars at the rate of need - was the actual event the purchase of the car?
<ul>
<li>Very often focus is on clock time, but managing projects successfully requires a focus on event time.  This doesn't mean that we ignore clock time.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
