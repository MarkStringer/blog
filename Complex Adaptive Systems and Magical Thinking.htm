<h1>Complex Adaptive Systems and Magical Thinking</h1>

<p>And it's got me thinking about complex adaptive systems.  I always
think about the Lean/Kanban question of "what is it?"</p>

<p>I'm starting to wonder if the question is "what does it want?" Weird

make all his money anthropomorphising genes?</p>
