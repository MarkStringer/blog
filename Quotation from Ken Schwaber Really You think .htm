<h1>Quotation from Ken Schwaber - Really? You think?</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important to equip a team with the best possible tools.  It's incredibly short-sighted to take expensive engineers performing important work and to hobble them with inadequate tools and infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
