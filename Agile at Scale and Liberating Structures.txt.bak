# Agile at Scale and Liberating Structures - a Glimmer of Hope

![Sunrise](SunRise.jpg)

Like so many famous quotations there's a dispute about who said that they rob banks because "That's where the money is."

But this is pretty much the only reason anybody has put "Agile" and "Scale" in the same sentence. In our heart of hearts, Agile practitioners knew that we didn't know how to scale Agile and we knew that SAFE, DAD, LeSS and - most embarrassingly of all - Nexus weren't going to cut it.  But big businesses with money wanted to pay us to (try) do it. Ironically perhaps, lot of those big businesses were banks.
 
Because everybody likes money - as Jerry Seinfeld says "that's what distinguishes us from the animals" - I've also had a go at pretending to know how Agile can Scale. But the "Emperor's new clothes" aspect of the whole endeavour defeated me.

The cognitive dissonance playing out on the face of the trainer on the SAFE practitioner course that I attended (I didn't sit the exam) was terrifying to behold and was one of the main things that put me off.

So, to be honest (and I *think* that's a big reason why I'm involved in this Agile endeavour) I've avoided the scale questions and concentrated on getting on with the bits of Agile that work: delivering software using Scrum teams and XP practices (why does that sound old fashioned?).

Then I stumbled on [liberating structures](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/) at a Lean coffee morning. I read the book and attended the course. There was no cognitive dissonance in evidence.

The central arugment of "Liberating Structures" is that most business is managed using "Five main conventional microstructures."
These are:

*   Presentations
*   Managed discussions
*   Status reports
*   Open discussions
*   Brainstorms

But I think actually in software development there are at least two other "standard structures" - at the mega level.

*   The deadline
*   The Gantt chart
*   Gates

I Agile we use some *different* microstructures - standup, sprint planning, retro, show and tell.

And parallel to the deadline and the Gantt chart we use two "mega level" strategies:

* The product backlog
* Velocity and burnup charts
* Iterative and incremental deliver of working software

When we've been challenged to come up with a description of how Agile might run at scale, it's *these* meetings that we've tried to use to solve the problems at every scale.

For example, Scrums work (reasonably well) as a state-sharing and problem-solving tool. But the same idea *doesn't* work so well at Scrum of Scrums level.  It just doesn't. In my experience it really only works when the representatives who turn up at the Scrum of Scrums are all working together on the same platform, so it acts as a kind of traffic management meeting. 

Even worse, the solution of SAFE is make Agile *look* like it's really about Gantt charts and gates.

But what if some *other* meeting, at some *other* frequency, did work at that level? What if we could admit that what that would be might be different in different organisations, but we have some candidates that we can suggest to start with? (from the canon of liberating structures I think these would be "What? So what? Now what?" and "What I need from you").

I've got to admit I'm a tiny bit excited now.
