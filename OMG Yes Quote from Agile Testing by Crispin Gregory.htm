<h1>OMG Yes! Quote from 'Agile Testing' by Crispin &amp; Gregory</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Implementing a continuous integration process should be one of the first
  priorities of any software development team. If your team doesn’t have at
  least a daily verified build, stop what you’re doing and get one started.</p>
